# Odin Project - Restaurant Page
This is the restaurant page project from the javascript section of the Odin 
Project. The objectives of this project were to configure a Webpack project by
using its documentation, load assets, and manage output. This project uses a 
simple HTML template with DOM manipulation handled strictly in code.

## Implementation
At the heart of this project is Webpack 5. As per requirements all assets are
handled by the bundler. The HTML Webpack plugin is used in conjunction with a
simple template as the root of the project. Javascript bundle sizes are kept
with dynamic code splitting.
